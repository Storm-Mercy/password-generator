# password-generator

## Description

I created a password generator that will make a randomized password that is 8 to 128 characters long. The characters it can conist of is special characters,  upper case characters, lower case characters, and numbers. If someone does not listen to the direction and types in characters on the prompt that asks how long they want their password, it will aler them and tell them it must be numbers for the lenght only. I also have it to where it returns them to the beggining if they go through and hit cancel on all the options of what kind of characters they want.
